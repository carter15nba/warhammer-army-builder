This project is part of my Master Thesis, which is aimed towards the Warhammer universe. The project aim to create a program which will create the army that most probably will achieve victory against the opponent. This is will be achieved through interaction with the user, Case-Based Reasoning and generated explanations to inform the user (gamer).
